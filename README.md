# stress-strain-hysterisis
The following code is a simulation of a few stress-strain loops of a simple elasto-plastic material. The stress value is oscillated with with different amplitudes. The aim is to evaluate the dissipation between the loading and unloading phases, as well as the stress amplitude dependency of said dissipation.
